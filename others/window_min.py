"""
Tracks the minimum value within a k-sized window, 
that slides through a (possibly infinite) stream of integers.

Solution: 
- Store the minimum candidates in a deque. At each new element:
    - remove candidates from the head of the deque that aren't on the window anymore.
    - remove candidates from the tail that are bigger than the new element

Using a heap, each new element would incur an O(logk) cost.
This solution gives an amortized O(1) cost.
